# Medical Imaging Woekshop

6-day workshop involving real-world projects using pre-trained models (VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, Xception), along with custom CNNs enhanced with attention and differential attention mechanisms.
 
A deep dive into the practical applications of deep learning in healthcare using hands-on projects in critical areas, including:
 
 - Ovarian Cancer Classification
 - Autism Detection
 - Brain Tumor Classification
 - Chest X-Ray Classification
 - Spine X-Ray Classification
 - Oesophageal Cancer Detection
 - Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Detection
 - Fetal Ultrasound Image Classification
 - Skin Cancer Detection
 - Bone Fracture Detection
 - Object Detection
 
 Learned:
 - How to use pre-trained models to tackle complex medical imaging tasks.
 - Implementatoin of attention and differential attention mechanisms to focus on key image features.
 - Developed custom CNN models tailored to different medical image types.
 - Techniques in object detection to identify specific features or regions within medical images.
