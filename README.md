# Medical Imaging Woekshop

6-day workshop involving real-world projects using pre-trained models **(VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, Xception)**, along with custom CNNs enhanced with attention and differential attention mechanisms.
 
A deep dive into the practical applications of deep learning in healthcare using hands-on projects in critical areas, including:
 
- **Ovarian Cancer Classification** - Using machine learning to classify ovarian cancer images, focusing on detecting tumor markers or patterns in ovarian tissue.
- **Autism Detection** - Applying diagnostic algorithms for early autism detection, likely focusing on behavioral pattern recognition or MRI data analysis.
- **Brain Tumor Classification** - Using MRI or CT images to classify types of brain tumors, helping differentiate between malignant and benign cases.
- **Chest X-ray Classification** - Implementing deep learning models to detect and classify conditions such as COVID-19, pneumonia, and tuberculosis from chest X-rays.
- **Spine X-ray Classification** - Utilizing X-ray images to detect abnormalities in the spine, potentially including scoliosis or other degenerative conditions.
- **Oesophageal Cancer Detection** - Identifying esophageal cancer in imaging studies, focusing on detecting early signs of malignancy.
- **Parkinson's Disease Detection** - Developing methods to identify Parkinson's disease, potentially using gait analysis, voice recordings, or neuroimaging.
- **Fetal Ultrasound Image Classification**- Analyzing fetal ultrasound images to detect anomalies, aiding in prenatal care.
- **Skin Cancer Detection** - Employing image classification models to detect various types of skin cancer, such as melanoma, based on dermatoscopic images.
- **Bone Fracture Detection**- Detecting and classifying bone fractures in X-ray images, potentially focusing on different anatomical locations and fracture types.
 
**Learned:**
 - How to use pre-trained models to tackle complex medical imaging tasks.
 - Implementatoin of attention and differential attention mechanisms to focus on key image features.
 - Developed custom CNN models tailored to different medical image types.
 - Techniques in object detection to identify specific features or regions within medical images.
